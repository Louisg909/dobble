# Current
- [ ] Check the dobble card output as it is glitched - check translations and then check sizing
- [ ] Change the random distribution of sizes to uniform distribution


# Card organising
- [ ] Add some form of positioning on the card to determine where each icon will be situated
- [ ] Integrate icon class, adding random jitter, rotations, size, etc
- [ ] Add the checks, and the following corrections, for icon overlaps on the cards


# Card rendering
- [ ] Make item images
- [ ] Make way to automatically make dictionary from /icons directory
- [ ] Make way to generate a high resolution PNG of a card, bassed on the positioning, rotation etc of the items in a card object
    - [ ] Fix positioning so they all are in the correct placces
    - [ ] Fix scaling so they are the right size, and not squashed
    - [ ] Fix memory issues
- [ ] Make something to go through each card in the deck, and save it as a PNG to an output directory
- [ ] Make a way to print all of the cards off? Might be able to just press print ngl...

# Documentation
- [ ] Add logic behind the card rendering to README.md
- [ ] Make README.md more thorough
- [ ] Make wiki for documentaiton? General documentation of code
- [ ] Add loads of comments everywhere to make the software very readable - and change variable names where clearer ones could be used.
